    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
   <p> Hi! My name is Odebunmi Subomi. I’m an 18-year-old girl studying software engineering at Babcock University. Coding wasn’t something I was super into at first, but I’m starting to find it interesting as I learn more and develop my skills.

I’m a huge fan of manga, manhwa, and donghua, and I love getting lost in the amazing stories and stunning art styles. Anime is another one of my passions—it’s the perfect escape after a busy day. I’ve also started vlogging recently and have only posted my first video, but I’m looking forward to sharing more of my journey!

I’m someone who loves having fun but also really values my personal space. Sometimes, I just need time alone to recharge. One thing I can’t stand is when people tell me what to do—especially if we don’t click.

I enjoy crocheting (on and off, hehe), experimenting with aesthetic pens and stationery, and learning about new recipes to try. Cooking and creating something delicious in the kitchen is so satisfying, and I’m always open to discovering new dishes.

All in all, I’m a mix of creativity, curiosity, and independence, figuring out life one step at a time while doing the things I love.</p>
